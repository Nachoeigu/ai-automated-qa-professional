# About the project

This software enables you to respond to job-related questions using your personal and professional information. It can be seamlessly integrated with external applications, such as bots, to automate responses in job application forms.


# How to set it up?

Create a info.md file in the "resume" folder inside this repository. Put the more information as possible about you, your preferences, salary expectation, your work experience, your background, certifications, courses, tools, etc.

The info.md file should contains the following sections:
ABOUT ME, PREFERENCES, JOB EXPERIENCE, PROJECTS, EDUCATION and CERTIFICATIONS AND COURSES.

You can add also two other files in the resume folder like "long_version.md" and "short_version.md" so you can place two version of your resume based on the amount of tokens you want to consume per call.


# Methology
I try to integrate the power of LLMs in order to develop this software that answer job-related question. I think it performs better than RAG methologies based on particular cases I tested.
